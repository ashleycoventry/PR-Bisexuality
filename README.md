All materials, data, and analysis scripts can be found on the project OSF page (<https://osf.io/m2yjx/>) and the Github page (<https://github.com/ashleycoventry/PR-Bisexuality>). All links to specific files below link to files uploaded to OSF. All analyses were run using R.

STUDY 1 INFORMATION

*Materials:*

The survey used for Study 1 can be found at <https://osf.io/gwxv8>. This survey was used as part of a larger study focusing on LGBT mating psychology.

*Raw Data:*

Participants were recruited through Prolific and Qualtrics's panel service, so we have two raw data files. Both files are necessary for running the data processing script.

You can find the Prolific raw data here: <https://osf.io/pdhu5>.

You can find the Qualtrics panel raw data here: <https://osf.io/d74mb>.

You can find the data processing script here: <https://osf.io/dkny8>.

*Data Analysis*

You can find the processed data here: <https://osf.io/75svy>. This was the data used for analyses in the analysis script.

You can find the analysis script here: <https://osf.io/qxuka>. This analysis script includes all analyses and figures reported in the Study 1 section of the manuscript, as well as any supplementary analyses referenced.

STUDY 2 INFORMATION

*Materials:*

The survey used for Study 2 can be found here: <https://osf.io/a6ds9>.

*Raw Data:*

Participants were recruited through Prolific. The raw data file can be found here: <https://osf.io/6rd7f>.

The processing script can be found here: <https://osf.io/6py3t>.

*Data Analysis:*

You can find the processed data here: <https://osf.io/qd7z4>. This data was used for all Study 2 analyses.

You can find the analysis script here: <https://osf.io/n38fb>. This analysis script includes all analyses and figures reported in the Study 2 section of the manuscript, as well as any supplementary analyses referenced. This script also includes the integrated analysis in the supplemental materials which requires the Study 1 processed data (linked above).

SENSITIVITY ANALYSES INFORMATION

*Data Analysis:*

This analysis script requires both the Study 1 and Study 2 processed data (linked above). It also requires a pooled data set (combining Study 1 and Study 2 data) that is generated in the Study 2 script. This data file has also been saved to the OSF (<https://osf.io/hmdfz>) but can be generated using the Study 2 analysis script as well.

The sensitivity analysis R script for all sensitivity analyses can be found here: <https://osf.io/m8cjh>.
